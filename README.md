# Spellbook API (Team Epimetheus Project 2)

Spellbook is a REST API that allows users to browse, manage, and purhase from a collection of magic spells that they can use on their adventures in the Lands Between. Buyers can view and purchase available spells, while sellers can add, remove, or update spells in the listing. The application is designed to run off of a Kubernetes cluster with Grafan, Loki, and Prometheus services deployed for monitoring purposes.

Team Epimetheus consists of Aaron Cunanan (lead), Jazlyn Maxwell, and Craig Zamora
